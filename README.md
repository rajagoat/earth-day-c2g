**Note**: To be able to run the server inside the backend folder, you will need a `.env` file inside the `backend` folder with the following information:
```
PORT=<your port number>
MONGO_URI=<uri that is used to connect to the mongodb cluster>
```

To run the project, create two separate terminals. Then, on the first terminal:
```
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```
Similarly, on the second terminal:
```
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
